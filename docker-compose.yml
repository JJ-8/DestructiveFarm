    #  - localhost/TCP/5000 -> only accessible to docker host running this docker compose file.
    #                          (I suspect this is enough for nginx/ctfnote?)

    #  Just to be clear, `vpn` is just a dns name that resolves to a docker-internal IP. This
    #  does not host the web server to the CTF network.
